# Cloud-Native Task Tracker API

A basic production ready, cloud native task tracking API built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**, packaged as a fully containerized microservice.

This project has been continously updated from my previous lost git repos.
This project is based on modern software delivery practices with **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and a **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** that automatically tests, builds, and publishes versioned container images to Docker Hub.

Features

* **FastAPI-powered REST backend** with autogenerated Swagger UI
* **MongoDB persistence layer** with clean CRUD operations
* **12-Factor cloud-native configuration** via env variables (`MONGO_URL`, `MONGO_DB_NAME`)
* **Fully containerized** using Docker
* **Local development stack** using Docker Compose (API + MongoDB)
* **Automated CI/CD** with GitHub Actions:

  * Dependency installation
  * Test execution (`pytest`)
  * Docker image build
  * Automated push to Docker Hub (`latest` + commit SHA)

## Important softwares and tech I used

* Python 3.12
* FastAPI
* MongoDB
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Pytest
* GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

##  Quickstart — Run the API Container Instantly

If you only want to run the API (without MongoDB):

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 kanishk1105/task-tracker-api:latest
```

Further accessing  my apps services(it is important to make sure docker is running in termial!):

* **API Root:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* **Swagger Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

---

## Full Stack (API + MongoDB) via Docker Compose

Clone and start the full environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VanquisherCodes/cloud-native-task-tracker.git
cd cloud-native-task-tracker
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

* API → [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* Docs → [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
* Internal MongoDB instance @ `mongodb://mongo:27017`

Shutdown:

```bash
Ctrl + C
docker compose down
```

---

##  CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Every push to `main` triggers:

1. Python environment setup
2. Dependency installation
3. `pytest` test suite
4. Docker image build
5. Docker Hub login (via secrets)
6. Automatic deployment to Docker Hub:

   * `latest`
   * `<commit-sha>` versioned tag

---

## Future Enhancements

* Update task endpoint (`PUT /tasks/{id}`)
* Lightweight authentication (API key)
* Centralized logs + metrics
* Deployment to Render / Fly.io / Azure (I could not use it to due to the restriction imposed on my student subscription)/ AWS
